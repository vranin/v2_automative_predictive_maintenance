# Autonomous Predictive Maintenance

A voice-enabled, AI-powered predictive maintenance platform for connected vehicles.  

---

## Overview

This project leverages a team of specialized intelligent agents—each with a unique role—to automate and enhance every step of the vehicle maintenance lifecycle.  
Together, these agents collaborate to detect early issues, interact with users via voice, diagnose problems, arrange bookings, analyze trends, and gather user feedback.  
The goal is to bring modern AI-driven predictive maintenance and conversational support to vehicles, making car care proactive, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Voice Assistant:** Talk to the app to report problems, get updates, or book appointments.  
- **AI Anomaly Detection:** Real-time defect/maintenance analysis.  
- **Multi-Agent Workflow:** Including Diagnosis, Scheduling, Feedback, and Voice CEA agents.  
- **Custom Dashboard:** Visualizes logs, metrics, issues, and actions live.

## Agents & Modules

- **Master Agent:** Coordinates all other agents and manages the help/workflow process.  
- **Diagnosis Agent:** Finds faults and diagnoses possible car issues from logs or data.  
- **Data Analysis Agent:** Analyzes operational/history data to spot trends and improve decisions.  
- **Customer Engagement Agent (CEA):** Voice/chat assistant that talks to users, gets info, answers questions.  
- **Scheduling Agent:** Arranges maintenance bookings and optimizes schedules.  
- **Feedback Agent:** Collects user ratings/comments after service for improvement.  
- **Manufacturing Quality Insight (MQI) Module:** Spots long-term patterns in all data for better vehicle design and planning.
